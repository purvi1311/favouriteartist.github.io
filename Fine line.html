    <h2>ABOUT THE ALBUM</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
        Fine Line is the second studio album by English singer Harry Styles, released on 13 December 2019 
        by Columbia and Erskine Records. The album's themes involve the initial excitement of meeting someone, 
        break ups, and "having sex and feeling sad",[1] as Styles has said himself. 
        The record has been described as pop rock, with elements of prog-pop, psychedelic pop, folk, soul, funk and indie pop.
Supported by five singles—"Lights Up", "Adore You", "Falling", "Watermelon Sugar" and "Golden"—Fine Line debuted
 at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the Billboard 200, making it Styles' second consecutive 
 number-one album in the US.[2] The album had the third-largest sales week of 2019 in the US and broke the record as the biggest debut from a British male artist since Nielsen SoundScan began, earning 478,000 album-equivalent units.
