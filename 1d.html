        They topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including 
        "What Makes You Beautiful" (their first number one on the UK Singles Chart, and the highest debut 
        for a British act on the US Billboard Hot 100 since 1998), "Live While We're Young", "Best Song Ever", 
        "Story of My Life" and "Drag Me Down". After the release of Four, One Direction became the first band 
        in the US Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one. Their third album, 
        Midnight Memories, was the best-selling album worldwide of 2013.
        <br>
        On 22 July 2020, One Direction posted on their Twitter, Instagram and YouTube accounts a 
        picture with the words "10 Years of One Direction" written in it and the caption "Tomorrow! 
        You and me got a whole lot of history #10YearsOf1D" in anticipation of their 10th anniversary the following day. 
        The hashtag "10YearsofOneDiretion" started trending 1st on Twitter.

On 23 July, One Direction announced a new website <a href="https://www.10yearsof1d.com/" target="blank">10yearsof1d.com</a>
for fans to relieve their favourite One Direction memories, but it soon crashed shortly after its announcement 
due to the high volume of fans entering at once. Members Payne, Horan, Tomlinson and Styles also posted on their 
individual social media pages, thanking their fans and all five current/former members for the support given through 
the past 10 years.
