            Modelling alongside a selection of baby farm animals - piglets,<br> 
            lambs, kids - the singer strikes a series of playful poses in <br>
            the Renaissance gardens  of the historic Villa Lante estate, <br>
            which is just north of Rome.<br>
            “The campaign playfully positions Harry Styles’s personal, <br>
            urban take on the Gucci tailoring wardrobe amongst the classic,<br>
             stylised landscape  of the gardens, where fountains, grottoes<br> 
             and mazes characterise the ancient surroundings," reads a <br>
             statement released by the brand.<br>

         “I like a fragrance that has some emotion behind it,” <br>
        says the singer-songwriter and star of Gucci’s <br>
        new Mémoire d’une Odeur fragrance campaign, as he <br>
         fiddles with the vintage-looking bottle. <br> 
        “The triggering of memories from smell is really  <br>
        strong for everyone. My mother has always worn the  <br>
        same perfume.<br>


Mémoire is the newest addition to the Gucci fragrance family under  <br>
creative director Alessandro Michele’s, it's a perfume that has no gender.<br>

           Most of Harry Styles' tour outfits are made by Gucci and he does carry them very well.<br>
           He's always been bold with his fashion choices and they do treat him well, <br>
           he can pull off almost any outfit whethere glitter on glitter or horizontal stripes on vertical stripes.<br>
           He's not afraid to make these choices and this what the fans love about him the most.<br>
